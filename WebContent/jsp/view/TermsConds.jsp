<br /><br /><p>
We are a small, amateur organization, and as such have no legal background from which to best form this document. Because of this, to protect ourselves from any opportunistic and overly litigious members of society and ensure our lasting ability to contribute to the internet and our community, we accept no legal responsibility to our users. By accepting these terms, you, the user, relinquish the right to pursue legal action against this organization for content/actions associated with the website. Your accepting this agreement also gives us full access and control of any data you choose to upload to the site. This in mind, we will (without a legally binding commitment) adhere as close as possible to the following principals:
</p><br /><p>
We will not delete an account without good reason.<br />
We will not request more information than is necessary for site function.<br />
We will inform you of any changes made to the privacy policy of the site as they happen, and give you the option to remove your account should you disagree with the changes.<br />
We will not use or share data uploaded to the site in any manner beyond targeted advertising without informing you ahead of time.<br />
We will do our best to hold ourselves responsible to you, the users, and welcome all suggestions, comments, and concerns you may have.<br />
</p><br /><p>
We believe in privacy, accountability, and responsibility, and we hope to update our terms and conditions to reflect that as soon as possible. In the meantime, we hope you will accept our informal commitment and respect our legal distancing while we find our bearings.
