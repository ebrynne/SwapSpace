	<b>Who are you?</b><br />
	I am a university student studying computer science and business and working on my own projects for fun. I'm a geek, but I hope I can be a little more than that too. I'm come from an alternative background, which is probably where the idea for this site came from.
	<br /><br />
	<b>What is this?</b>
	Tough question. Where I come from barter is popular, and it came to me one day how little presence that has on the internet. So I took it upon myself to create a website where users can create their own little store, lay out their wares, and exchange with other users, good for good. With any luck people can start to build their own community around this, and I can continually update with new and interesting features along the way.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Can I help out?</b>
	Absolutely! I've built this on my own so far, but I never have enough time, and I most definitely have my weak points that I'd love shored up. If you would like to contribute to the site design and functionality itself contact me at assitance@swapspace.com, or if you want to help pay for my upkeep costs, you can make a payment to the paypay account I use for expenses. And as a starving student, I'd always appreciate any donations for food or rent money. :-) Thanks!
	<br /><br />
	<b>Why isn't my question up here?</b>
	Because you haven't asked it yet? If you need specific information or feel that there should be more information here or elsewhere, contact me at information@swapspace.com
